We've created this site to provide information to help get your team off
to a quicker start during dsmHack. Here you will find suggestions on various
technology stacks that you can consider when building solutions from your
nonprofit and some recommended best practices. Of course, your team is welcome
to choose any technology that you feel is best to help your nonprofit so please
don't feel that you have to limit yourself to the content of this site. Just
make sure to consider the following when choosing a solution:

* How will your solution be hosted and how much will that cost your nonprofit?
* How will your nonprofit make content changes or data updates after dsmHack?
  Do they have the skills necessary?
* How quickly can you really build a production ready solution in the suggested
  technology stack?  Can you have it done with all the features needed in 48 hours?

If you are not sure of a good tech stack that will have good answers to those
questions then that is where this site comes in handy.
